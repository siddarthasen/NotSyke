A multiplayer online game that allows friends to answer interesting questions about each other, usually with funny reponses. It is built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. Socket.io was also used to connect multiple players in a room, and Express.js was the framework for connecting all the respective parts of the app. The app is currently in the beta testing phase, where I am tweaking all the minor bugs and UI complications. The backend code is actively running on an AWS EC2 instance. Play it yourself at notsyke.com!
